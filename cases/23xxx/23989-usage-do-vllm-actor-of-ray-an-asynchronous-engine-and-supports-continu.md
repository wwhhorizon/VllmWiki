### Issue 正文摘录

### Your current environment ``` token_prompts = [TokensPrompt(prompt_token_ids=p) for p in request.prompts] outputs = await ray_actor.generate.remote( prompts=token_prompts, sampling_params=SamplingParams(**request.sampling_params)) ``` ### How would you like to use vllm I want to run inference of a [specific model](put link here). I don't know how to integrate it with vllm. ### Before submitting a new issue... - [x] Make sure you already searched for relevant issues, and asked the chatbot living at the bottom right corner of the [documentation page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), which can answer lots of frequently asked questions.
